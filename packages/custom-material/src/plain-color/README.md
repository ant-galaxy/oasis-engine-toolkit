# Plain Color Material

Since `UnlitMaterial` will be affected by scene effects such as fogging, it will have an impact on Toolkit such as
auxiliary lines, Gizmo, etc., so a plain color material is specially provided here. This material will not be affected
by any scene-level special effects. It is recommended to use this material for rendering auxiliary tools and plain color
line.
